- **Network configuration issues** → Document troubleshooting steps

### **Phase 2 Risks**
- **Agent communication complexity** → Start with simple HTTP, add complexity gradually
- **Database schema changes** → Use migration scripts
- **Performance bottlenecks** → Implement monitoring early

### **Phase 3 Risks**
- **Voice recognition accuracy** → Test with multiple STT services
- **Mistral performance issues** → Have quantization options ready
- **Audio processing complexity** → Use proven libraries

### **Phase 4 Risks**
- **External API limitations** → Implement rate limiting and fallbacks
- **Authentication complexity** → Use established OAuth libraries
- **Action execution failures** → Build robust retry mechanisms

### **Phase 5 Risks**
- **UI complexity** → Keep Streamlit interface simple initially
- **Real-time update issues** → Implement polling fallbacks
- **Integration problems** → Test components individually first

### **Phase 6 Risks**
- **Performance optimization challenges** → Profile before optimizing
- **Feature creep** → Maintain focus on core functionality
- **System complexity** → Keep architecture simple

### **Phase 7 Risks**
- **Testing coverage gaps** → Implement testing from early phases
